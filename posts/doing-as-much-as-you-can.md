The uniqueness of this game and creative card combos \[aliteration!] continue to impress me. A player must find the line to victory using a unique series of cards in the deck. My favourite part about this game is that, for each deck, the path to victory isn’t always the same. I’ve finished the game, or created a pile of Aember, from some cool combos in a deck and don’t see them again for several games. <br/> <br/> For instance, my 4 Horseman deck, ***Litbosset of the Scribe's School*** contains a copy of <Card name="Cleansing Wave"/>. My very first game with the deck I played <Card name="Horseman of Pestilence"/> into a crowded board followed by Cleansing Wave for an immediate 9 Aember. I thought the deck was unbeatable after that play! Fast forward a dozen games later and I still haven’t been able to put that rewarding combo together. This variation in game play, even in the same deck, keeps the game feeling fresh and new. Sometimes you’re able to put your favourite combinations of cards together, other times you have to find new ones, and sometimes you experiment with paths to victory that go awry.  

<DeckList name="Litbosset of the Scribe's School"/>

So this morning my KeyForge bro LD messages me, 

<XCards names="Horseman of Pestilence, Cleansing Wave"/>


“Hey Kurt, I just lost in the most ridiculous manner. You’ll never guess!”
Obnoxiously I reply, “You hit the concede button?”

“No… It was late in the game. We both had 2 keys and 4 Aember each. I play Key Hammer.”
<BigCard name="Key Hammer"/>

Seeing his clear path to victory, LD reaps for an Aember and then plays Key Hammer. 

The only problem is that his opponent didn’t forge a key on their last turn. He’s forgotten the golden rule of KeyForge! The card doesn’t care if your opponent forged a key on the last turn, after all you do as much of the card as possible.


Key forged last turn? No


Give the opponent 6 Aember regardless? Check


Pass turn, opponent has 10 Aember, opponent forges Key #3 for the win. 


An upsetting turn of events to cost you the game. Just remember, do as much as the card says!
