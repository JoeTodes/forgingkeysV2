Now for cards, if I just want a hoverable card name:
```html
<Card name="shooler"/>
```
and I get a hover image: <Card name="shooler"/> which is inline with the rest of the text!

<br/>
What if I want one big card in as a paragraph break with a caption? Just use BigCard:
```html
<BigCard name="bulwark" caption="very crisp"/>
```
<BigCard name="bulwark" caption="very crisp"/>
