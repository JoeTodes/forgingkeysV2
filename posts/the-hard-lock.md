Last night I went over to my friend’s house to play in our weekly tournament which has been happening since pre-release which is pretty awesome. Clearly no one in my friend group is bored of this game yet and hopefully this post should explain why. 
<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned in my last post how this game continues to impress me with how unique each and every game feels. Even your own deck, that you’ve played with a dozen times, teaches you something new. Such is the case with my friend Shawn. 
<DeckList name='Viceroy "Chowderfoot" Sorrow'/>
I sat down to play Shawn in match 2 last night after sure handedly getting trounced by LD. Shawn decided to switch up decks from game one to his ***Viceroy "Chowderfoot" Sorrow*** deck. ( Obviously emphasis on Chowdaaaah! ).

“It’s not very good” He proclaimed. 
<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a new deck last night, ***X. Chandra, Baron of the Secret Riverside***, which has the much talked about <Card name="Library Access"/>, a couple <Card name="Phase Shifts"/>, and a couple <Card name="Novu Archaeologists"/> to return the combo. Turn 1 against LD in the first game I had played 10 cards, though fizzled for a loss after that.
<DeckList name="X. Chandra, Baron of the Secret Riverside"/>
“We’ll see how this goes” I say. 
<br/>
<br/>
I roll a 6 to Shawn’s 5. I’m going first. My opening hand wasn’t anything special. I shuffle and mulligan. Even worse. 
<br/>
<br/>
“Uh… Shadows” and I play a <Card name="Dodger"/>. 
<br/>
<br/>
With a grin on his face, I know something is up. 
<br/>
<br/>
“Untamed!” and he lays down 3 exhausted creatures and plays an action. These particular 4 cards…

<XCards :names="['dew faerie','snufflegator','witch of the eye','s call']"/>



Now I didn’t see it at first. Maybe second glance. It didn’t sink in until after my next turn when I played a <Card name="Dextre"/>, <Card name="Mother"/>, and a <Card name="Novu Archaeologist"/> and passed. 
<br/>
<br/>
Shawn announced untamed again. Reaped with Dew Faerie for 2, with Snufflegator for 1, and Witch of the Eye for 1. 4 Amber total!
<br/>
<br/>
But wait! That Witch of the Eye trigger on Reap. Hey it returns a card from your discard pile to your hand. Looks like you have one card in discar…. Oh wait. Nature’s Call… 
<br/>
<br/>
Yep, Shawn brought back Nature’s Call, Cast is for his fifth Amber of the turn and send my board back to my hand. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was locked out. A few more turns like this and I was toast. Shawn only played those 4 cards the entire game to win. It took 5 turns and I was toast. I couldn’t do anything. 
<br/>
<br/>
“I didn’t know this deck could do that” Shawn said.
<br/>
<br/>
“I thought it was awful!”
<br/>
<br/>
There’s a 1:1.9M chance of drawing 6 specific cards in your opening hand in KeyForge. There’s a 1:630 chance of drawing this specific two card combo (Witch of the Eye and Nature’s Call). 1:1260 chance of doing so when you’re playing second (losing the coin flip) which I think is key to locking the board. Shawn broke the odds and I’m hoping, versus me, I don’t wind up in prison under the hard lock again (Though it was pretty cool!).
